hello world hello mapreduce
distributed systems are scalable
mapreduce processes large datasets
fault tolerance is important for distributed systems
workers execute map and reduce tasks
the map phase produces intermediate key value pairs
the reduce phase aggregates values by key
parallel processing enables fast computation
google designed mapreduce for large scale data
hadoop implements the mapreduce paradigm
