The original implementation was done using C++. I'll be abstracting most of the cpp methods and approaches to equivalence in python. 
This includes the basic grpc, Map, Shuffling and Reduce implementations. 

To-Know: 
- How proto files work
- Workings of grpc
- Workers and Client simulated processes and outputs
